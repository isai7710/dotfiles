# My dotfiles

Simple repo to store my dotfiles for my kitty, tmux, and oh-my-posh configs and customizations. My Neovim config is [here](https://github.com/isai7710/darksaber-nvim)

Note: Tmux and Kitty expect their config files to reside in ~ and ~/.config/kitty/ respectively, so symbolic links were created to these locations after cloning repo.
